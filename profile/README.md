# SourceMonitor

[Jim Wanner][jwanner] retired from software development. The software [SourceMonitor][sourcemonitor] will become open source. There are several things from preventing the code completely accessible for everyone e. g. licensed code, generated code of abandoned tools and other challenges.

This will be the new central home of SourceMonitor.

Every kind of support is welcome. Please reade the [SM-Info][sm-info] repository for more details.
